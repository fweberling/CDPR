# CDPR

Cable-Driven Parallel Robots

Includes my bachelor thesis written in matlab.

It's my goal to rewrite all that in python as soon as I find the freetime ;)

Implementation of the inverse and forward kinematics for a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) in Numpy

The forward kinematics is determined via several optimization algorithms:

  Gradient Descent
  Gauss-Newton
  Levenberg-Marquardt
  Powell's Dog Leg
